Right now, there are **three viable funding models** for an AI agent to have “money” and autonomously pay your gateway without you babysitting it.
Which one you choose depends on whether the payer is **a human end-user** or **another business**.

---

## 1) **Pre-Funded Wallet (Credits System)** – safest & simplest

* **How it works**

  * The agent’s owner (human or business) **deposits funds** into an account on your platform — via card, ACH, crypto, etc.
  * You hold a balance in **credits** (e.g., 1 credit = \$0.01) in your DB or Cloudflare D1/KV.
  * When the agent encounters a paywall, it spends credits instantly (no external Stripe checkout).
  * You deduct from the wallet and immediately mint the JWT access token.
* **Pros**

  * No per-transaction card fees (you charge them once on top-ups).
  * Instant, offline-capable payment from the agent’s perspective.
  * Easy to enforce **daily/transaction spend caps**.
* **Cons**

  * You need to manage balances & expiry.
  * Some compliance/KYC if balances get big.

**Example**

```json
{
  "wallet_id": "agent_123",
  "balance_cents": 5400,
  "currency": "USD",
  "spend_limit_day_cents": 500
}
```

When challenge hits → agent calls `/redeem` with `challenge_id` → your API deducts 50¢ from balance and returns token.

## 2) **Linked Payment Method with Budget Controls** – for trusted agents

* **How it works**

  * The owner links a **Stripe Setup Intent** (saved card), PayPal billing agreement, or crypto wallet to the agent’s identity.
  * When payment is required, the agent calls your `/checkout` API **server-to-server** and you charge the saved method.
* **Pros**

  * No pre-funding friction — just link once.
  * Great for agents doing unpredictable tasks where pre-funding is awkward.
* **Cons**

  * More risk of runaway spend.
  * You must have strong policy enforcement (allowlist domains, per-transaction cap).

**Control Strategy**

```json
{
  "linked_method_id": "pm_card_visa",
  "allow_domains": ["gateway.example.com","pay.acme.com"],
  "max_cents_per_txn": 300,
  "max_cents_per_day": 1500
}
```

If a challenge is over the cap → agent tool stops and requests human approval.

## 3) **Delegated/Third-Party Funding** – for enterprise/agent marketplaces

* **How it works**

  * Agents run on a platform (e.g., Goose, LangChain server, AgentHub) that already has **its own billing relationship** with customers.
  * The platform pays your gateway on behalf of the agent, then bills the end-user in their monthly invoice.
* **Pros**

  * You skip all direct payment/KYC handling.
  * One customer → hundreds of paying agents.
* **Cons**

  * You depend on platform integrations.
  * Revenue share negotiation.

**Flow**

```
[Agent Platform Wallet] --pays--> [Your Gateway]
                               <--token--
[Platform] bills [End-User] monthly
```

## Putting It in Your Agent Skill

If we implement the **`paywall.pass`** skill I outlined earlier, we simply add a **funding backend**:

```json
{
  "funding_model": "wallet",
  "wallet_id": "agent_123",
  "balance_cents": 5000,
  "max_cents_per_txn": 200,
  "max_cents_per_day": 1000,
  "linked_method_id": null
}
```

* **Wallet mode** → deduct from stored credits.
* **Linked method mode** → make a charge via Stripe API.
* **Delegated mode** → forward to platform API.

## My Recommendation for Your Launch

Since you want to serve this on **Cloudflare’s block pages**, the fastest, safest path to \$3K/week is:

1. **Start with pre-funded wallets** (credits).

   * Users deposit \$10–\$100.
   * Agents spend down credits instantly for each paywall encounter.
2. Add **budget policy in the MCP tool** so an agent never exceeds a limit.
3. Later, integrate **saved cards** for enterprise accounts where pre-funding is a barrier.

---

If you want, I can extend the **Cloudflare Worker** we just built so it:

* Maintains **per-agent credit balances** in KV/D1,
* Deducts credits on `/redeem`,
* Refuses challenges if balance < cost, and
* Exposes `/wallet/topup` for humans to fund their agents.

Do you want me to design that wallet layer next?
