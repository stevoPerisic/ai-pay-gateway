Here’s a consolidated **execution plan** that ties together the paywall handshake \[7], Cloudflare AI-powered blockpage gateway \[8], and agent wallet funding models \[9] so you can go from **POC → production → monetization**.

---

## 1. Foundation Setup (POC Phase – Week 1)

**Goal:** Get a working AI paywall running on a Cloudflare Worker, intercepting bot/agent traffic and serving a machine-readable payment challenge.

1. **Create Worker & KV Namespace**

   * Use the TypeScript Worker from \[8] as the base.
   * Add KV binding (`KV`) for session & receipt storage.
   * Add AI binding (`AI`) for Workers AI messaging.
   * Add JWT secret and Stripe credentials via `wrangler secret`.

2. **Integrate Machine-Readable Handshake**

   * Add `.well-known/agent-paywall` endpoint \[7].
   * On bot/agent detection, return **HTTP 402 JSON** with:

     * `challenge_id`
     * pricing options
     * payment methods
     * return URL
   * Publish minimal OpenAPI spec for `/checkout`, `/redeem`, `/status`.

3. **Route Traffic**

   * Use Cloudflare WAF to route low bot score, curl, Tor, or premium route traffic into the Worker.

4. **Test Human Path**

   * Confirm HTML blockpage loads, AI copy explains payment.
   * Stripe checkout works, JWT cookie set, access granted.

## 2. Agent Skill + Funding (Week 2–3)

**Goal:** Let agents pay automatically without human intervention.

1. **Build MCP Tool** (`paywall.pass`)

   * Input: `gateway_base`, `challenge_id`, `option_id`, `budget_cents`, `payment_method`.
   * Behavior: `/checkout` → `/confirm` (wallet or card) → `/redeem` → return `{ token, cookie_name, expires_at }`.

2. **Implement Pre-Funded Wallet System**

   * Store balances in KV/D1 \[9].
   * `/wallet/topup` → user adds funds.
   * `/redeem` deducts credits if balance ≥ price.
   * Enforce per-day and per-transaction spend caps.

3. **Agent Budget Controls**

   * Domain allowlist
   * `max_cents_per_txn`
   * `max_cents_per_day`
   * Human escalation if over cap.

4. **Dogfood**

   * Run your Goose agent against the Worker.
   * Confirm auto-payment via wallet and correct token redemption.

## 3. Production Hardening (Week 4–5)

**Goal:** Secure, scalable, multi-payment-method system.

1. **Security**

   * Verify Stripe webhook signatures.
   * Add Turnstile to blockpage to reduce junk hits.
   * Durable Objects for rate-limiting and concurrent session control.
   * Signed HMAC between Worker and origin.

2. **Multi-Payment Support**

   * Add Lightning (BTCPay), Crossmint, or Google/Apple Pay.
   * Offer subscriptions and day passes alongside micropayments.

3. **Data Layer**

   * Migrate receipts and wallet balances to D1 for analytics and export.
   * Nightly backups.

4. **Logging & Auditing**

   * Log `{agent_id, domain, option_id, amount, challenge_id}` for receipts.

## 4. Monetization & GTM (Week 6+)

**Goal:** Launch as SaaS + usage-based product.

1. **Pricing**

   * SaaS lane: \$49/mo/site (Basic), \$199/mo (Pro with analytics).
   * Usage lane: 5–10% on payments processed.

2. **Target Markets**

   * API/data providers
   * E-commerce with scraper issues
   * Media/premium content publishers

3. **Case Studies**

   * “Recover blocked traffic into revenue.”
   * Show before/after revenue for bot traffic.

4. **Distribution**

   * Cloudflare App Marketplace
   * GitHub “Deploy with Wrangler” button
   * Outreach to Goose/LangChain agent dev communities.

---

## 5. Scale & Extend

* Add **Linked Payment Method** funding for trusted enterprise agents \[9].
* Build **Delegated Funding** integrations with major agent platforms.
* Layer in **dynamic AI pricing** based on request value.
